1.Two Sum-
    Problem: Given an array of integers and a target value, find two numbers such that they add up to the target.
    Example: Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9. Output: [0, 1].

2.Merge Intervals-
    Problem: Given a collection of intervals, merge any overlapping intervals.
    Example: Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]. Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]].

3.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock-
    Problem: Given an array where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, find the maximum profit you can achieve.
    Example: Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]. Output: 5.

4.Move Zeroes-
    Problem: Given an array, move all zeroes to the end without changing the order of non-zero elements.
    Example: Input: [0,1,0,3,12]. Output: [1,3,12,0,0].

5.Maximum Subarray-
    Problem: Find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.
    Example: Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]. Output: 6.
