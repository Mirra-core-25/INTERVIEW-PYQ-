1. Two Sum-
    Problem: Given an array of integers and a target value, find two numbers such that they add up to the target.
    Example: Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9. Output: [0, 1].

2. Find the Duplicate Number-
    Problem: Given an array of integers, find the duplicate number.
    Example: Input: [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]. Output: 2.

3. Merge Sorted Array-
    Problem: Given two sorted integer arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.
    Example: Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], nums2 = [2,5,6]. Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6].

4. Majority Element-
    Problem: Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
    Example: Input: [3,2,3]. Output: 3.

5. Reverse String-
    Problem: Write a function that reverses a string.
    Example: Input: "hello". Output: "olleh".

6. Linked List Cycle-
    Problem: Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
    Example: Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1. Output: true.

7. Climbing Stairs-
    Problem: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
    Example: Input: n = 2. Output: 2.
